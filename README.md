Welcome to Jackson-Gabble
===

welcome.experiencejackson.com was created by a group of graduate students at the University of Michigan School of Information as part of the [Citizen Interactive design project](http://ginsberg.umich.edu/article/winter-2014-citizen-interaction-design-school).

It displays lists about favorite things to see and do in Jackson which can be shared and voted on ("liked") by other subscribers.

It was built with the help of professional software developer [Lawrence Siden](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=10061735), contracted through [TekSystems, Inc.](http://www.teksystems.com), using [MEAN-stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN) technology and [Twitter Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com).
